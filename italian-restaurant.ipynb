    "The owners of a chain of Italian restaurants in Portland, OR wants to expand to the Seattle, WA region, so they commissioned a study to understand which potential locations would be best to open a new establishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are mostly interested in the suburban areas, in particular the downtowns and city centers of the cities in the Greater Seattle Area.\n",
    "\n",
    "They would like to know more about the existing restaurants in those areas, both to gauge areas where there are already many restaurant choices (so they are typically visit by crowd that might be interested to try the new restaurant) and they're also interested in the potential competition from other comparable establishments, particularly other Italian restaurants that would potentially \"split\" the customers who are seeking Italian food.\n"

    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "From interviews with a few locals, we narrowed down a handful of areas that would look interesting, that seem to be \"go to\" locations for people frequenting restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will gather data from Foursquare for these locations, in particular we will look at the total number of restaurants in each one of them. Still looking at the categories, we will narrow these down to determine which are actually sit-down restaurants vs. fast food options or coffee/desert shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a closer look at the Italian restaurants in each of these areas, getting all the details for these venues from Foursquare, in order to gauge their price tier, rating and other factors that will help us determine how popular and how good these places are. These are potentially very direct competition, so we would like to avoid an area already overserved by Italian restaurants. We will also include Pizza restaurants in this more detailed search, since that's still quite direct competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after summarizing data for all venues of eacho location, we will segment the locations using a k-means clustering algorithm. By aggregating the data from each cluster, we'll be able to describe high-level location profiles that will help our customer narrow down their search, and finally drill down to the ideal location by looking at the more detailed data for the locations in the most relevant cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "K-Means Clustering is a useful technique to segment data into similar clusters, which can be very helpful in narrowing down a decision on a large group of options. By grouping them into a handful of clusters, we can initially pick the cluster that looks most interesting, then dig down into the smaller number of specific elements inside that cluster.\n",

    "The Python tools for Data Science (Pandas, IPython, Jupyter, etc.) make it very easy to explore data dynamically, while at the same time keeping a \"paper trail\" and at the same time allowing for a pretty report to be produced, which makes it easy to go from ad-hoc exploration, to a draft, to a final report that looks very professional.\n",
